# Student-Management-System
Java Spring application providing ability to add some user data, store it in the database (I used MySQL) and display this data in form of a list on a website.


                                              ====== Before you run an application  ====== 
In src/main/resources/templates check application.properties file. In the first line of code, enter the name of the database you are going to use(I used database named sms). Also enter your datasource username and password to run this application.
