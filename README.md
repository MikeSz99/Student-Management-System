Java Spring application providing ability to add some user data, store it in the database (I used MySQL) and display this data in form of a list on a website.


                                              ====== Before you run an application  ====== 
 1.In src/main/resources/templates check application.properties file. In the first line of code, enter the name of the database you are going to use(I used database named sms).
